Annotation analysis
===
Includes the whole pipeline from annotating and filtering probes to differential expression analysis, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses. Exercises included

Annotation packages
---
Using microarray annotation packages, re-map probes

Filtering genes
---
Removing less biologically interesting genes. Collapsing multiple probes for the same gene into one variable

Differential expression analysis
---
Using *limma* for differential expression analysis. *geneplotter* for visualizing genes within the genome

Enrichment analyisis
---
Using *topGO* for gene ontology enrichment analysis. Creating custom enrichment analysis and applying it to Reactome pathway enrichment analysis.
