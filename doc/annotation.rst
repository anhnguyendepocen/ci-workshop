Annotation and enrichment analyses
==================================

.. Day 2, 4-5p

Outline
=======

Converting among identifiers
============================

- Gene IDs: Entrez Gene, RefSeq, UCSC, Ensembl
- biomaRt

Enrichment analysis
===================

- Basic idea
- A bit of statistical theory

- Specific annotations & examples:
    - Gene Ontology
        - Explain the 3 trees, is_a vs part_of, evidence codes
        - Show how to browse the ontology (maybe even in cytoscape?)
        - Show a big list of all the GOEA packages
        - Show DAVID, for lazy people
        - Simple worked example
        - Fisher exact (mention historically, Binomial), multiple testing
        - Different methods of incorporating the graph structure into GOEA
        - Does method exist to exploit evidence codes?
    - KEGG
